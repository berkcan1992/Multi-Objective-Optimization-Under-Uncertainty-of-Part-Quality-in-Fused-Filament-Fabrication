Multi-objective optimization

DEAP and platypus are used to do the multi-objective optimizations.

## ParetoOptim_AM_DEAP_3var
Performs a pareto front optimization for 3 integer variables (printer temperature, speed and layer height).

## ParetoOptim_AM_DEAP_3var_Exp_Design
Since evolutionary algorithms are stochastic algorithms, therefore results of *ParetoOptim_AM_DEAP_3var* must be assessed by repeating experiments until a statistically valid conclusion is reached by using *hypervolume* computation.

## ParetoOptim_AM_DEAP_3var_Exp_Animation
Save the animation of the Pareto optimal fronts

## ParetoOptim_AM_DEAP_3var_Exp_Hypervolume
Calculate the hypervolume indicator wrt. number of generations


## ParetoOptim_AM_DEAP_3var
Performs a pareto front optimization for 3 integer variables (printer temperature, speed and layer height).
Objective functions are BL (overall mean and standard deviation of the bond length, and thickness)

## MOO_Case1-Copy1
Multi-objective-optimization of case 1. Pareto front plotted.

## MOO_Case1-Copy1_MCS
Multi-objective-optimization of case 1. Pareto front plotted with MCS results.
